Movie Recommendation System
Project Overview
This project is an intelligent movie recommendation system designed to help users discover new films that match their personal preferences. In a world with an overwhelming amount of streaming content, the goal is to solve the "paradox of choice" by providing personalized, relevant, and engaging movie suggestions. The system will leverage machine learning techniques, specifically collaborative filtering, to analyze user behavior and generate accurate recommendations.

Key Features
Robust Recommendation Engine: Utilizes machine learning to suggest movies.

Dataset Integration: Built using a standard, publicly available dataset like MovieLens.

Performance Evaluation: Measures the accuracy of recommendations using metrics like RMSE, precision, and recall.

Simple User Interface: Provides a basic front-end to demonstrate the system's functionality.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python

Core Libraries:

Pandas & NumPy for data analysis

Scikit-learn (and potentially TensorFlow/PyTorch) for machine learning

Backend: Flask or Django

Version Control: Git
